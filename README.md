# Case-Opening-Game
Select option 1 to open a case, items are randomly generated with rarities, special, covert, classified, restricted, and milspec. Probability of items are, Special = .0025575, Covert = .0063939, Classified = .0319693, Restricted = .1598465, and Milspec = .7992328
Option 2 allows for the user to view their inventory, it displays the total number of items obtained in each rarity.
Option 3 exits the game.
The program generates a text file each time it runs that contains the inventory.
In the future I plan on implementing this game on a browser and storing user inventories. Also, I want to implement a marketplace where users can sell/trade items.
